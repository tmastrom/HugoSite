I am studying computer engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering at the University of Victoria. Topics I am currently pursuing include image and signal processing and embedded systems. Please check out my [Projects](https://tmastrom.github.io/projects/) page as well as my [Github](https://github.com/tmastrom/) for some examples of my work.
